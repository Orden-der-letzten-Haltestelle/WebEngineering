# Monolyth
We decided, to use an Monolyth system, bc:
## 1. Simplicity 
A Monolyth is simpler to develop, and bc. of the limited resources, we decided, to use a monolyth architecture build. 
Which is perfect, for smaller teams.

## 2. Deployment 
Since all components of the application are in one codebase, debugging and tracing issues across the system can be more straightforward. This is particularly advantageous during the initial stages of development when rapid changes and debugging are frequent.
